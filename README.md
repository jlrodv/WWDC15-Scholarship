# WWDC15-Scholarship (Winner)
This is my app submission for the WWDC 2015 Scholarship. This year Apple asked students to make the app in Swift or Swift/Objective-C. I took the challenge and this is my first app entirely made in Swift.

I only have 48 hours available to make it and finished it 5 minutes before the deadline. 

Please don't use this app to submit it to future scholarships. Take it only as a reference.
